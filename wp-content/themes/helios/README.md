# Helios

Helios is a Storefront child theme, Genesis WordPress framework built with Bootstrap 5, webpack, and a ton of npm packages.
Helios was originally built with Grunt, later on with Gulp and I'll be using Vite next.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)

## Quickstart

- [Download this starter compass project and unzip it](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-compass-template/archive/master.zip)

Then when you're working on your project, just run the following command:

```bash
compass watch
```

## Upgrading

If you'd like to upgrade to a newer version of Foundation down the road just run:

```bash
bower update
```
