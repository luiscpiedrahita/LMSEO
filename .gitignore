# This is a template .gitignore file for git-managed WordPress projects.
#
# Fact: you don't want WordPress core files, or your server-specific
# configuration files etc., in your project's repository. You just don't.
#
# Solution: stick this file up your repository root (which it assumes is
# also the WordPress root directory) and add exceptions for any plugins,
# themes, and other directories that should be under version control.
#
# See the comments below for more info on how to add exceptions for your
# content. Or see git's documentation for more info on .gitignore files:
# http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitignore.html

# CLEANING THE REPOSITORY
# If you've added this .gitignore file in an existing repository, you may want to remove the content that should be ignored. Here is how to do that.
# you can use a wildcard to remove all files, and then add all the files back, and then commit the updates.

# $ git commit -m "Pre Cleanup"
# $ git rm -r --cached .
# $ git add .
# $ git commit -m ".gitignore setup and cleaned up"


# Ignore everything in the root except the "wp-content" directory.
